# Pastiche
An android app using TensorFlow Lite to apply artistic style transfer.

## Why this app?
The main idea is to allow people to apply an artistic style from one piece of art to their own picture. A small preloaded selection of artworks will be included in the app for the user to engage with. The user will also have the ability to take their own picture and use it to apply an artistic style transfer to another picture of theirs. After an artistic style transfer has been completed the user can then download the result or share it.

## What is in this repo?
The app is in this repo. That's about it.

## Stages of development
### MVP (In Progress)
- Apply a style transfer from one of the preloaded artworks
- Save to Camera Roll

### V1.0 (Not Started)
- Apply a style transfer from a user's photos
  - Using the camera
  - From their camera roll

### V2.0 (Not Started)
- Share to Social Media

### V3.0 (Not Started)
- Unlock more artworks by visiting art museums

## Tech Stack
This section will change over time but currently this is what we are looking like:
- Kotlin
- TensorFlow Lite
- CameraX

## The name
The word pastiche means an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work, artist, or period. While using this app you will create your own pastiches based on a variety of artworks. After you've tried out some of the included artworks feel free to expirement by creating your own artworks and patterns that can be applied to a photo.

## Outro
That's all folks. No end credit scenes to be found here. Check back later for some screenshots/pretty graphics. Hit the star if you like it or open an issue if you hate it.
