# Pastiche
An android app using TensorFlow Lite to apply artistic style transfer.
![Pastiche Promotional Wide](/screenshots/promotionalWide.png)

## Why this app?
The main idea is to allow people to apply an artistic style from one piece of art to their own picture. A small preloaded selection of artworks will be included in the app for the user to engage with. The user will also have the ability to take their own picture and use it to apply an artistic style transfer to another picture of theirs. After an artistic style transfer has been completed the user can then download the result or share it.

## Current Status
Here are the different states the app can be in. Camera preview (left), art style selection (middle), and stylized output (right).
![Pastiche State of App](/screenshots/statesOfTheApp.png)
The results are varied and strongly correlates to the style of artwork. Very simple and distinctive styles are most likely to produce great results. Complex styles are more likely to produce results that seem to match more to the color palette and sharpness of the original artwork. Abstract paintings with few features and soft watercolor pastels seemed to produce some of the best results.

## Stages of development
### MVP (In Progress)
- Apply a style transfer from one of the preloaded artworks
- Save to Camera Roll

### V1.0 (Not Started)
- Apply a style transfer from a user's photos
  - Using the camera
  - From their camera roll

### V2.0 (Not Started)
- Share to Social Media

### V3.0 (Not Started)
- Unlock more artworks by visiting art museums

## Tech Stack
This section will change over time but currently this is what we are looking like:
- Kotlin
- TensorFlow Lite
- CameraX

## The name
The word pastiche means an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work, artist, or period. While using this app you will create your own pastiches based on a variety of artworks. After you've tried out some of the included artworks feel free to expirement by creating your own artworks and patterns that can be applied to a photo.

## Outro
That's all folks. No end credit scenes to be found here. Check back later for some screenshots/pretty graphics. Hit the star if you like it or open an issue if you hate it.
