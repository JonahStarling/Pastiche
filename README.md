# Pastiche
An android app using TensorFlow Lite to apply artistic style transfer on collectable real life art pieces.

The main idea is to allow people to be able to collect and apply an artistic style from one piece of art to their own picture. For example, a user can go to an art museum and scan an abstract painting they really like. After scanning that piece of art will be added to their collection. The user can then take a picture and apply the art style from any of the art pieces they've collected to their own photo. They'll be able to apply style transfers from any photo onto their own photo, but the main idea will be to collect art pieces from real life and apply those styles onto their own photos. The goal of the app is to get more people to go to art museums and get them to engage with the art. Collecting different artworks will encourage people to actually get out there and try to find different artworks.

## Challenges: 
- First challenge will be using TensorFlow Lite and it's support library to apply an artistic style prediction model on the artwork and then a style transform model on the desired picture.
- Second challenge will be figuring out best way for users to scan and collect art. Easy way would be to use special QR codes next to art works. Hard way would be implementing some artwork recognition (probably out of scope for this project).
